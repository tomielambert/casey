  <p>Back in my freshman year I met a very interesting boy who I never thought would end up so important to me!</P>

 <p>While moving through the years of high school, life had a lot of twists and turns. As I became a sophmore I began to admit my feelings for you. Whenever I was in trouble and needed a shoulder to cry on, you were always there with love and support.</p><img src="images/Casey.jpg" width="200" height="300"/><p>At the end of a very long three years Im finally able to call you mine and I've never been happier to be with someone! When you're reading this, I truely hope it makes you smile and feel loved because for all you do for me you deserve the best!<p/>

 <p> Being able to be by your side through the ending of your senior year of high school felt insane to say the least. Going to prom with you and seeing that big cute smile the first time you saw me in my dream makes me so happy and honestly very nervous. Even though prom was boring, I'm glad I got to experience it with you!<p/></div>
